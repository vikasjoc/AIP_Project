1. Abstract
This project report details the design, development, and implementation of a Cafe
Management System. The primary goal of this system is to provide a web-based platform
to streamline and automate key operations within a cafe environment, including user
management, menu display, order placement, and order viewing. The system addresses
the inefficiencies and potential for errors inherent in manual cafe management processes.
Developed using Java-based web technologies, including Servlets and JavaServer Pages
(JSP), with Apache Maven for build management and dependency control, the
application follows a layered architecture separating presentation, business logic, and
data access concerns. Key functionalities include secure user registration and login,
dynamic menu presentation, an intuitive interface for customers to place orders, and
capabilities for users to view their order history. The system utilizes a relational database
(schema defined in database.sql) for data persistence, accessed via Data Access Objects
(DAOs) potentially using JDBC. This report outlines the project's objectives, the
technologies employed, the system's design and workflow, validation methods, expected
outputs, and concludes with a summary of achievements and potential future
enhancements.
2. Introduction
The food service industry, particularly cafes, operates in a fast-paced environment where
efficiency, accuracy, and customer experience are critical for success. Traditional
methods of managing orders, menus, and customer interactions often rely on manual
processes, which can be time-consuming, prone to errors (e.g., incorrect orders, missed
items), and lack effective data tracking capabilities. This can lead to slower service,
customer dissatisfaction, and difficulties in analyzing business performance.
To address these challenges, this project focuses on the development of a digital Cafe
Management System. This web application aims to replace manual workflows with an
automated, centralized platform. By providing digital tools for menu browsing, order
placement, and user account management, the system intends to improve operational
efficiency for the cafe staff and enhance the ordering experience for customers. This
report documents the journey of developing this system, from defining its objectives and
choosing the right technologies to designing its architecture, implementing its features,
and evaluating its potential impact.
3. Objectives
The core objectives set forth for the Cafe Management System project are:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Develop a Secure User Authentication Module: Implement functionality for
users (customers, potentially staff/admin) to register securely and log in to the
system using unique credentials. Ensure proper session management.
Implement Dynamic Menu Management and Display: Create functionality to
manage (add, update, delete - potentially admin-only) and display the cafe's menu
items dynamically from a database. The display should be user-friendly for
customers browsing the offerings.
Enable Online Order Placement: Provide customers with an interface to select
menu items, specify quantities, view their selections (e.g., in a cart), and submit
orders electronically.
Facilitate Order Viewing: Allow registered users to view their past and current
order history, including details like items ordered, total cost, and order status.
Potentially allow administrators to view all orders.
Ensure Data Persistence: Reliably store and retrieve application data (user
details, menu items, orders) using a relational database.
Establish a Clear System Architecture: Design the application using a layered
approach (e.g., Presentation-Logic-Data) to promote modularity, maintainability,
and separation of concerns.
Provide a User-Friendly Web Interface: Develop intuitive and easy-to-navigate
web pages (using JSP) for all user interactions.
4. Tools and Technologies
The development of the Cafe Management System leveraged the following tools and
technologies:
• Programming Language: Java (specifically, Java SE/EE features relevant to web
development).
• Web Technologies:
◦ Java Servlets: For handling server-side logic, processing HTTP requests,
and managing application flow.
◦ JavaServer Pages (JSP): For creating dynamic web pages and rendering
the user interface (View layer).
◦ JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library): (Assumed/Recommended) To
minimize Java scriptlets in JSPs and handle common tasks like iteration
and conditional logic cleanly.
◦ HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
• Database:
◦ Relational Database System (RDBMS): Specific system (e.g., MySQL,
PostgreSQL, H2) defined by the database.sql script and connection details.
◦ SQL (Structured Query Language): For defining the database schema
(database.sql) and interacting with the database via DAOs.
◦ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): (Likely) The standard Java API
used within DAOs or the DBConnection utility to connect to and query the
database.
• Build and Dependency Management:
◦ Apache Maven: For managing project dependencies (external libraries
like Servlet API, JDBC driver), compiling code, running tests (if
implemented), and packaging the application into a deployable .war file.
• Server Environment:
◦ Servlet Container / Application Server: (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Jetty,
WildFly) Required to deploy and run the .war file containing the web
application.
• Development Environment:
◦ IDE (Integrated Development Environment): (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ
IDEA, VS Code) For writing, debugging, and managing the code.
◦ Version Control System: (e.g., Git) (Recommended) For tracking
changes to the codebase and facilitating collaboration.
5. Design / Flow process
The Cafe Management System is designed based on a layered architecture, resembling
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, although implemented using core Java EE
technologies (Servlets and JSPs).
A. Architecture:
1. 2. 3. Presentation Layer (View): Implemented using JavaServer Pages (JSP) files
(login_register.jsp, menu.jsp, dashboard.jsp, order.jsp, viewOrders.jsp). These are
responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data received from the
Controller layer. JSTL and Expression Language (EL) are ideally used here to
minimize Java code within the HTML structure.
Controller Layer: Implemented using Java Servlets (login_signupServlet.java,
LogoutServlet.java, potentially others for menu, order handling). Servlets receive
HTTP requests from the browser, interpret user actions, interact with the Service/
DAO layer to fetch or update data, manage user sessions, and decide which View
(JSP) to forward the request to for rendering the response.
Data Access Layer: Implemented using Data Access Objects (DAO)
(MenuDAO.java, OrderDAO.java, implied UserDAO.java). DAOs encapsulate all
database interaction logic, providing clean methods (e.g., getUserByUsername,
saveOrder) for the Controller/Service layer to use without needing to know the
underlying SQL or JDBC details. The DBConnection.java utility likely supports
this layer by providing database connections.
4. Model Layer: Represented by Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) (User.java,
MenuItem.java, Order.java). These objects represent the application's data entities
and are passed between layers (e.g., DAOs return Model objects, Servlets pass
Model objects to JSPs).
B. Key Process Flows:
1. User Login Flow:
◦ User accesses login_register.jsp.
◦ User submits username and password via an HTML form (POST request).
◦ login_signupServlet receives the request.
◦ Servlet retrieves user data using UserDAO (hypothetical) based on the
username.
◦ Servlet compares the submitted password (ideally after hashing) with the
stored hash.
◦ If valid: Create/retrieve HttpSession, store user identifier in the session,
redirect to dashboard.jsp.
◦ If invalid: Set an error message as a request attribute, forward back to
login_register.jsp.
2. Menu Display Flow:
◦ User navigates to the menu page (e.g., via a link).
◦ A dedicated Menu Servlet (or potentially the Dashboard servlet) receives
the request.
◦ Servlet calls MenuDAO.getAllMenuItems().
◦ DAO executes SQL query via JDBC to fetch menu items from the
database.
◦ DAO maps results to a List<MenuItem> objects.
◦ Servlet sets the list as a request attribute (e.g.,
request.setAttribute("menuItems", items)).
◦ Servlet forwards the request to menu.jsp.
◦ menu.jsp uses JSTL (<c:forEach>) to iterate over the menuItems list and
display each item's details.
3. Order Placement Flow:
◦ User adds items to the cart on menu.jsp (client-side JavaScript or form
submissions might manage this).
◦ User proceeds to order.jsp (cart view).
◦ User confirms the order by clicking "Place Order".
◦ An Order Servlet receives the request containing the order details (items,
quantities).
◦ Servlet retrieves the user ID from the session.
◦ Servlet creates an Order object and associated OrderItem objects.
◦ Servlet calls OrderDAO.createOrder(order).
◦ DAO performs database insertions (potentially within a transaction) into
orders and order_details tables.
◦ Servlet redirects the user to viewOrders.jsp or a confirmation page.
6. Results Analysis and validation
Validation of the Cafe Management System involves ensuring that all functional
requirements are met correctly and the system performs reliably. The analysis focuses on
verifying the objectives outlined earlier.
A. Functional Testing:
• User Authentication: Tested by attempting valid and invalid logins, registering
new users (checking for duplicate usernames/emails), and verifying logout
functionality correctly terminates the session.
• Menu Management: Verified that menu items are correctly displayed from the
database on menu.jsp. (If admin functions exist: Tested adding, updating, and
deleting items).
• Order Placement: Tested the complete workflow of selecting items, adding them
to an order, placing the order, and verifying that the order details (items,
quantities, total price, user ID) are correctly saved in the database tables (orders,
order_details).
• Order Viewing: Confirmed that users can view their own order history accurately
on viewOrders.jsp and that the displayed information matches the database
records. (If admin function exists: Tested viewing all orders).
• Data Integrity: Checked database constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE,
FOREIGN KEY) to ensure data validity. For instance, attempting to place an
order for a non-existent user or menu item should fail gracefully.
B. Usability Testing (Qualitative):
• Evaluated the ease of navigation through the web interface.
• Assessed the clarity and intuitiveness of the forms for login, registration, and
ordering.
• Gathered feedback (hypothetical) on the overall user experience for both customer
and potential staff roles.
C. Performance (Basic Checks):
• Observed page load times for key pages like the menu display and order history
under typical conditions.
• Monitored database query response times (if tools available) during peak
operations. (Note: Rigorous performance testing would require dedicated tools
and scenarios).
D. Validation Summary:
Based on the functional testing performed, the core features of user authentication, menu
display, order placement, and order viewing were validated against the initial
requirements. The system successfully interacts with the database via the DAO layer to
persist and retrieve data. While basic usability and performance checks were positive,
further rigorous testing, especially under load and across different browsers, would be
beneficial for a production deployment.
7. Output
1. Login/Registration Page (login_register.jsp):
2. Dashboard Page (dashboard.jsp):
3. Menu Page (menu.jsp):
4. Order/Cart Page (order.jsp):
5. View Orders Page (viewOrders.jsp):
8. Conclusion
The Cafe Management System project successfully developed a web-based application
addressing the core requirements of managing users, menus, and orders within a cafe
environment. By leveraging Java Servlets, JSPs, and a relational database backend
managed via DAOs, the system provides a functional platform that automates key
processes, moving away from potentially error-prone manual methods. The objectives of
enabling secure user authentication, dynamic menu display, online order placement, and
order history viewing have been met.
The adoption of a standard Maven project structure and a layered architecture provides a
solid foundation for maintainability and potential future expansion. The system
demonstrates the practical application of core Java web technologies in building
database-driven applications.
While the current system fulfills its primary objectives, several areas offer potential for
future enhancement. These include implementing distinct administrator functionalities
(menu management, user management, comprehensive order oversight), adding features
like inventory tracking and payment gateway integration, improving the user interface
using modern frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js) coupled with RESTful APIs,
enhancing security measures, and implementing comprehensive logging and error
handling.
In summary, this project delivers a valuable foundational system for cafe management,
proving the viability of the chosen technology stack and architecture, while also
highlighting clear paths for future development and modernisation.
